<h1>Download</h1>

<p>
First, make sure you have <a target="_new" href="https://cran.rstudio.com/">installed R</a>. If you're on OSX
and have <a target="_new" href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you can run
</p>

<div class="code shell">
  <pre>
# Run this from your command line terminal.
brew tap homebrew/science && brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz && brew install r
  </pre>
</div>

<br />
<p>
Downloading Syberia into a sandbox that does not interfere with your usual
R package library can be done by running the minimal example project:
</p>
<br />

<div class="code shell">
  <pre>
# Run this from your command line terminal.
git clone git@github.com:syberia/example.sy.git && cd example.sy && R
  </pre>
</div>

<br />
<p>If you are having trouble, scroll down to the <a href="#trouble">troubleshooting</a>
section.</p> After the packages have downloaded and your R session opens 
type

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
run("example"); model$predict(iris[1:5, ])
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>If everything worked correctly, you should see some model predictions.  </p>

<p>Let's walk through what happened during this process.</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>The command <pre class="inline">git clone git@github.com:syberia/example.sy.git</pre> 
        pulled the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/example.sy">example project</a> GitHub
        repository down and then we moved to the directory using <pre class="inline">cd example.sy</pre>. 
    <li>We started R, upon which it immediately began processing the project's
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/example.sy/blob/master/.Rprofile">Rprofile</a>,
        the file all R sessions execute during startup.
    <li>The Rprofile in the example project installed the devtools, purrr, and R6 packages
        from CRAN as well as <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/robertzk/testthatsomemore">testthatsomemore</a>
        and <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/robertzk/lockbox">lockbox</a>. The former is
        an extension of the testthat R unit testing package, whereas the latter is
        an equivalent of <a target="_new" href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> for R: it will keep
        a separate directory for all of the packages we download so they do not clash
        with your global R package versions.</li>
    <li>The Rprofile finally called <pre class="inline">lockbox::lockbox("<a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/example.sy/blob/master/lockfile.yml">lockfile.yml</a>")</pre>.
        This file is parsed by lockbox to understand which packages we need for this
        project. If you ever want to load more packages, <i>place them in the lockfile</i>
        instead of adding <pre class="inline">library</pre> or <pre class="inline">install.packages</pre>
        calls. This ensures pushing and pulling the project to and from version control
        loads an R session with the same packages across your whole team's computers.</li>
    <li>Lockbox installed some packages, the most important ones being 
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/syberia">syberia</a>,
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/director">director</a>,
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/mungebits2">mungebits2</a>,
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/tundra">tundra</a>, and
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/stagerunner">stagerunner</a>.
        These form the core of the current Syberia modeling engine. As with
        the <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>,
        Syberia aims to create <i>small, reusable tools</i> that <i>do one job well</i>.
    <li>The Syberia project was initialized using <pre class="inline">syberia::syberia_project()</pre>.
        This <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/syberia/blob/master/R/engine.R#L123">bootstrapping procedure</a>
        builds an R object called a <pre class="inline">syberia_engine</pre> that is built
        off a <pre class="inline">director</pre> and will manage all the files and directories
        in your project.</li>
    <li>During project bootstrapping, the project's <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/example.sy/blob/master/config/engines.R">engines file</a>
        was read to understand what "kind" of Syberia project you will be working on.
        In our case, we wish to make some production-ready machine learning models, so
        Syberia downloaded and loaded the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy">modeling engine</a>.
        Similar to <a target="_new" href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Rails engines</a>,
        Syberia itself is a skeleton and offers no functionality: all of the real meat
        is in the engines you mount and use in your projects, and creating new ones is trivial.</li>
    <li>The modeling engine's <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy/blob/master/config/engines.R#L1">engines file</a>
        specified a dependency on the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/base.sy">base engine</a>.
        For now, most Syberia projects will be built off the base engine, but this may
        change once Syberia starts replacing outdated R project structures like packages.</li>
    <li>If all went well, the <pre class="inline">syberia_engine</pre> loaded and mounted
        both engines in the appropriate hierarchy of dependencies. Syberia takes care of
        downloading, mounting, and maintaining your engines. The modeling engine's
        <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy/blob/master/config/boot.R#L2">boot file</a>
        was executed to attach a new namespace called <pre class="inline">syberia:modeling</pre>
        to your R search path. This is used to provide global helper functions like 
        <pre class="inline">run</pre> so that they do not clash with your global namespace.</li>
    <li>You have a freshly printed Syberia session up and running! We'll cover what
        happened when you executed <pre class="inline">run("example")</pre> in a little bit.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>If you ran into any problems during the above process, continue reading
   for the troubleshooting guide (or use ctrl+F to jump straight to your error message).
   Otherwise, you can <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/syberia/issues/new">file a new issue</a>
   on GitHub explaining your problem and the Syberia core team will jump to the rescue.</p>

<p>Note the above process installed Syberia into a custom library managed by lockbox.
   To install it globally, run:</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
devtools::install_github("syberia/syberia")
    </code>
  </pre>

<h2>Cannot open file '~/.R/lockbox/.staging/magrittr/R/magrittr.rdb': No such file or directory</h2>

<p>This is an issue with <a href="https://github.com/robertzk/lockbox">lockbox</a> 
on certain system configurations. Restarting R should fix the issue. Otherwise,
try executing the following command from the terminal and then restarting R.
(Make sure you are starting R from the root of the example project so that you
load the necessary Rprofile.)</p>
